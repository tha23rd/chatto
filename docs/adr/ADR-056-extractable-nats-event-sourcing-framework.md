# ADR-056: Incubate an Extractable NATS Event-Sourcing Framework

**Date:** 2026-07-30

## Context

[ADR-033](ADR-033-event-sourced-state-with-projections.md) deliberately chose a
small internal Go package instead of a third-party event-sourcing framework.
That package now owns proven NATS JetStream mechanics for mandatory OCC,
ordered projection replay, read-your-writes barriers, failure propagation, and
optional restore capabilities.

Chatto's composition layer has also accumulated application policy around those
mechanics: stable diagnostic keys, display names, memory estimates, snapshot
eligibility, domain model ownership, and the concrete `corev1.Event` envelope.
Combining those concerns into a richer Chatto-specific runtime abstraction
would make today's wiring shorter but make a future standalone library harder
to identify and extract.

Projection-aware models additionally received projections and projectors as
separate constructor arguments. Nothing in those signatures proved that the
projector owned the supplied projection, so a wiring mistake could combine a
read model with another projection's replay frontier.

## Decision

Treat the nested `pkg/events/` module, imported as
`hmans.de/chatto/pkg/events`, as the incubator for a small Event Sourcing on
NATS framework that may later move to a standalone repository.

Framework-owned responsibilities are:

- opaque-byte event-log reads, OCC-only publishing, and atomic append
  mechanics;
- stream positions and projection readiness barriers;
- ordered consumer, replay, startup batching, and failure lifecycles;
- bounded durable pull-worker execution over application-configured consumers,
  including progress heartbeats, confirmed acknowledgement, delayed retry, and
  poison-delivery termination;
- optional snapshot and local-checkpoint capability hooks that bind persisted
  state to an opaque application-supplied stream identity; and
- a typed `ProjectionHandle` that keeps a projection with the exact projector
  constructed for it.

Chatto-owned responsibilities remain:

- the concrete event envelope, event vocabulary, subjects, and aggregate
  choices;
- domain projections, services, authorization, and response assembly;
- stable registration keys, display names, admin memory estimates, and
  diagnostic inventory;
- stream identity discovery, metadata naming, format, and validation;
- durable consumer names, stream selection, subject filters, delivery policy,
  domain decoding, idempotency, and terminal-state decisions;
- snapshot enablement, repository, encryption, retention, and worker policy;
  and
- runtime composition in `ChattoCore`.

`evtstream.NewProjectionHandle` is Chatto's normal construction path over
`events.NewDecodedProjectionHandle`. Code adapting an
already-created projector may use `evtstream.BindProjectionHandle`, which rejects a
projector built for a different projection. Both constructors require pointer
projection implementations so the projector and read side cannot receive
separate value copies. Projection-aware models consume handles rather than
parallel projection/projector arguments.

`EncodedEventLog` is the envelope-neutral storage boundary. It owns NATS
message-ID deduplication, OCC headers, atomic batches, stream positions, and
opaque record reads. Chatto's `evtstream.Publisher` is the typed adapter that
validates `corev1.Event`, uses its stable ID, and protobuf-encodes or decodes at
the boundary. This preserves the existing persisted bytes and lets the write
mechanics evolve without knowing Chatto's event vocabulary.

`NewDecodedProjector` is the matching envelope-neutral replay boundary.
Applications supply an `EventDecoder[E]` and `EventProjection[E]`; the
framework retains ordered consumption, subject filtering, startup batching,
readiness, snapshots, checkpoints, and failure handling.
`internal/evtstream` owns Chatto's `NewProjector`, `Projection`,
`SequencedEvent`, and publisher APIs as specializations over `corev1.Event` and
its unchanged protobuf codec. The events module has no production dependency
on Chatto protobufs or subject policy.

`DurableWorker` is the matching envelope-neutral effect-execution boundary.
Applications supply an already configured durable JetStream pull consumer and
an opaque-byte handler. The framework bounds local concurrency and owns message
heartbeats, acknowledgement, retry, termination, and shutdown handoff. The
application still defines what constitutes valid input, successful completion,
and an idempotent retry. Transient pull failures are retried so an embedded
worker does not turn a recoverable broker restart into a process failure.
If the supplied consumer is deleted or no longer exists, the worker returns an
error instead of retrying a stale handle forever. Recreating, replacing, or
retiring that application-owned consumer remains outside the framework.
Handlers must honor cancellation: the framework first cancels any outstanding
pull, then stops heartbeats and schedules active-delivery redelivery just beyond
the maximum pull lifetime so an orphaned server-side request cannot reclaim the
handoff. It retains lifecycle ownership until those handlers return. Chatto's
asset-processing runtime unit
is the first production consumer and retains its existing durable consumer
contract.

Chatto owns its versioned EVT incarnation format and the
`chatto.evt.incarnation` stream metadata through `internal/evtstream`.
Composition passes Chatto's resolver into snapshot and checkpoint
configuration. At restore time the projector invokes it with the same fresh
`StreamInfo` used for sequence bounds, preventing an old identity from being
combined with a recreated stream's bounds. The projector and snapshot
repository require only a non-empty opaque result and never impose Chatto's
metadata key or identity syntax. Snapshot capture carries the identity bound to
that projector run alongside its state and cutoff; application publication
does not maintain a second identity value.

The framework is exposed as the independently versioned incubation module
`hmans.de/chatto/pkg/events`, so code outside Chatto's module can compile and
test against the same exported surface Chatto uses. The module remains pre-1.0
and does not promise API stability. Its repository path is `pkg/events/`, and
its release tags use `pkg/events/v<version>`. ADR-059 licenses the complete
shared module under Apache-2.0 without changing its pre-1.0 stability status.
A future repository move should preserve the module identity unless a
deliberate rename justifies an import migration.

Chatto declares the module dependency explicitly and uses a repository-local
`replace` while the framework is co-developed here. This keeps `GOWORK=off`
builds honest about the module boundary without requiring a framework release
before an atomic Chatto change can compile. Consumers outside this repository
use normal tagged module versions; the local replacement is not part of the
framework module itself.

Extraction will happen only when concrete framework users show the smallest
useful public API. An external-package consumer contract acts as the first such
user: it owns a non-Chatto JSON envelope, subject policy, typed event-log
adapter, and projection while exercising only exported framework APIs. Future
generic surface should be justified by friction in this kind of consumer
rather than by a desire to shorten Chatto-specific wiring.
Authling is the first concrete second application. It can drive incremental
extraction when it needs a proven mechanic through this public seam, without
importing Chatto's `internal` packages.

## Consequences

Projection ownership and replay readiness can no longer be mismatched silently
in normal wiring. Model constructors are shorter, and the reusable lifecycle
unit is visible both in the core runtime and the independently runnable bundled
search provider.

New event-sourcing mechanics should be evaluated for the `pkg/events/` module;
new Chatto policy should stay in `internal/core` or the owning runtime unit.
This creates a reviewable extraction boundary without forcing premature API
stability or generic abstractions.

Durable workers can share transport and process-lifecycle mechanics without
turning product effects into a framework-owned business outbox. Because the
consumer configuration remains application-owned, rolling-deployment policy
and persisted consumer names stay visible at the composition boundary.
ADR-069 defines the explicit application-owned lifecycle and retirement policy
for those durable resources.

The handle adds one small generic API and an identity check for adapting
existing projectors. It intentionally does not absorb registration metadata or
snapshot policy, so some application composition remains explicit.

Extraction still requires deliberate work. The reusable module does not depend
on any Chatto production package: its production imports are
limited to the Go standard library and `nats.go`. It privately classifies the
JetStream wrong-last-sequence errors needed to preserve `ErrConflict` rather
than depending on Chatto's application-wide JetStream helpers. Generic
projection replay can use another application envelope without changing the
ordered lifecycle, while `internal/evtstream` keeps Chatto's storage contract
explicit and unchanged.

The external consumer contract proves live OCC publication, read-your-writes
waiting, conflict reporting, projector shutdown, and cold replay through the
same public surface. It is an executable extraction seam, not a second
production event model or a promise that the current package API is stable.

The framework test suite is portable with the module: it owns its in-process
JetStream fixture and no-op logger instead of borrowing Chatto test helpers.
Tests add only `nats-server/v2` to the standard library and `nats.go`
dependencies allowed in production. The repository workspace composes the
module for local development, while `mise test-events` also tests it with
`GOWORK=off`.

ADR-057 temporarily places Authling in the same repository so it can drive
this extraction without making either product part of the other.
