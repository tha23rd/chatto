This inventory records mounted transport and service boundaries. The generated
[ConnectRPC API reference](../../apps/docs-website/src/content/docs/reference/connectrpc-api/index.mdx)
is authoritative for individual RPCs, request and response messages, and public
method documentation.

## Transport boundaries

| Surface | Mount | Contract | Access boundary |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | --------------- |
| Public ConnectRPC | `/api/connect/chatto.{auth,discovery,api,admin}.v1.*` | Unary Connect, gRPC, and gRPC-Web services | Explicit per-service public or authenticated-user policy; method-level authorization remains inside operation models |
| Realtime WebSocket | `GET /api/realtime` | Binary `chatto.realtime.v1.Realtime*` frames | Bearer token in the hello frame or same-origin cookie; per-event authorization in `StreamMyEvents` |
| Protected attachments | `GET /assets/files/{assetId}` and image transform variants | Per-user URLs use hourly issuance buckets with 23–24 hours of remaining validity; Chatto streams full responses, while passive S3-backed video, audio, and large files can redirect to short-lived presigned URLs | Signed `access` ticket, authenticated cookie, or bearer token; every request rechecks room membership before resolving storage or exposing binary bytes |
| Protected HLS video | `GET /assets/hls/{assetId}/master.m3u8`, rendition playlists, and segments | Master and media playlists are generated from the durable manifest; segments are complete bounded responses from NATS or S3 | Domain-separated source-video `access` ticket; every request rechecks room membership and every segment ID/role against the durable HLS manifest |
| Public catalog assets | `GET /assets/emoji/{assetId}` and `GET /assets/sound/{assetId}` | Immutable custom-emoji images and soundboard clips from the shared server-asset backends | Public only while the owning catalog projection positively declares the asset |
| Inbound channel webhooks | `POST /webhooks/incoming/{webhookId}/{token}` and `/github` | JSON or multipart message posting, plus a GitHub payload adapter | URL token is the sole authorization and is constant-time compared by HMAC; 25 MiB body cap and per-replica fixed-window rate limit |
| Operator ConnectRPC | `/api/connect/chatto.operator.v1.*` on the configured Unix socket | Root-equivalent local unary services | Unix-socket filesystem permissions; never mounted on the public listener |
| Trusted NATS services | `svc.chatto.>` and `svc.chatto_ext.>` | Versioned protobuf request/reply through NATS micro services | NATS account permissions; extension providers receive only their configured service and upstream Core subjects |
| Reflection | `/api/connect/grpc.reflection.v1*` and `v1alpha*` | Public service descriptors | Public; restricted resolver excludes internal `chatto.core.v1` persistence types |

The public HTTP edge mounts every handler returned by `connectapi.API.Handlers`.
Authenticated services are wrapped with `connectrpc.com/authn` before protobuf
decoding and validation. `ExternalIdentityAuthService`,
`ServerDiscoveryService`, and reflection are public; all other public-listener
services require an authenticated user. The Operator API uses
`connectapi.API.OperatorHandlers` and is mounted only on the configured Unix
socket.

## Mounted public services

| Package | Public services | Auth policy |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| `chatto.auth.v1` | `ExternalIdentityAuthService` | Public capability-token flows |
| `chatto.discovery.v1` | `ServerDiscoveryService` | Public discovery |
| `chatto.api.v1` | `AssetService`, `AssetUploadService`, `CustomEmojiService`, `MessageSearchService`, `MessageService`, `MyAccountService`, `NotificationPreferencesService`, `NotificationService`, `PushNotificationService`, `RoleService`, `RoomDirectoryService`, `RoomService`, `ServerService`, `SoundboardService`, `ThreadService`, `UserService`, `ViewerService`, `VoiceCallService` | Authenticated user |
| `chatto.admin.v1` | `AdminCustomEmojiService`, `AdminDiagnosticsService`, `AdminEventLogService`, `AdminPermissionService`, `AdminRoleService`, `AdminRoomLayoutService`, `AdminServerService`, `AdminSoundboardService`, `AdminUserService`, `AdminWebhookService` | Authenticated user; methods enforce administrative permissions |

## Mounted operator services

| Package | Service | Access policy |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| `chatto.operator.v1` | `OperatorUserService` | Root-equivalent access over the private Unix socket |

## Trusted NATS services

The `chatto.search.v1` provider contract defines normalized query and readiness
messages under `svc.chatto_ext.search.v1.>`. `search.Client` validates both
sides of request/reply, maps NATS micro error headers, and treats missing
responders or the bounded provider-call deadline as provider unavailability.
Compatible providers share a queue group for replica load balancing. Ready
status and queries use `.status` and `.query`; startup progress uses
`.status.startup` only as a fallback when no ready status responder exists.
The bundled provider joins both ready queues only after replay is current.

This is a trusted server-side integration surface, not a public client API.
Query responses contain thin message and room IDs. The public
`MessageSearchService` prefilters provider queries to the caller's complete
current member-room set. It then uses
`MessageSearchReadModel` and the normal timeline hydrator to recheck room
membership, current body availability, and message/room identity before
returning canonical `Message` resources. Public cursors encrypt and authenticate
the provider cursor and bind it to the viewer and complete public request.

The bundled provider runs under `chatto run` when
`search_provider.enabled = true`; the same unit runs standalone through
`chatto search-provider`. `search.enabled` independently controls whether the
public service accepts queries. `GetStatus` preserves disabled, indexing,
ready, degraded, and unavailable states without affecting other APIs. Exact
provider replay counts stay on the trusted NATS contract and in operator logs;
the authenticated public status does not expose server-wide event-log scale.

`ServerDiscoveryService.GetServer` is the only Connect method for which the
bundled client enables side-effect-free GET. It also receives wildcard public
CORS and conditional-response caching. Other bundled-client Connect traffic
uses POST.

The discovery response includes the server software version, stable protocol
capability keys for mounted public packages and negotiated contracts, and an
optional minimum bundled-web-client version. The
`chatto.realtime.projection.v1` capability is the bundled 0.5 client's gate for
opening realtime protocol 2, the only accepted behavioral version. The
`chatto.role-colors.v1` capability gates additive role-colour writes and the
derived public user colour field for mixed-version clients. The
`chatto.realtime.v1` suffix is the protobuf namespace. This metadata is public
pre-authentication state.
It describes wire support, not enabled server features or the authenticated
viewer's permission-derived capabilities. Multi-server clients refresh it per
server and use version comparison only to classify older servers that omit
capability metadata.

`chatto.api.message-search.v1` advertises the public Search wire contract even
when the operator disables the feature. Compatible clients use
`MessageSearchService.GetStatus` for configured availability and transient
provider readiness rather than interpreting the protocol capability as an
enablement flag.

`chatto.api.room-manager-member-reads.v1` advertises that effective
`room.manage` grants channel-room `ListMembers`, `GetMember`, and
`BatchGetMembers` reads without requiring the manager to join. Current clients
gate the room-member management surface on this contract; version comparison is
used only for legacy servers that omit capability metadata.

Public URL generation prefers the configured `webserver.url`. Without it, the
HTTP edge uses only the direct request TLS state and host; forwarded protocol
headers are not implicitly trusted. `webserver.trusted_proxies` affects client
IP attribution and realtime same-origin comparison, not public URL authority.

Chatto-streamed protected attachments are sequential full responses. They
advertise `Accept-Ranges: none` and ignore `Range`, returning `200` with the
complete object. NATS-backed video is therefore not seekable. Passive S3-backed
media redirects after authorization to a presigned object URL whose storage
backend provides byte-range delivery.

Processed videos can instead expose HLS. Six-second MPEG-TS segments make
seeking and adaptive rendition switching independent of byte-range support.
HLS child responses remain behind Chatto so membership loss revokes an already
issued playlist ticket on its next playlist or segment request.
