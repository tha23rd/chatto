# Projection Inventory

Projections are derived read models rebuilt from `EVT`. Most live in memory;
optional providers may own disposable locally checkpointed indexes.
`NewChattoCore` registers each top-level core projector once with a stable
machine-readable key, such as `content_keys`, and a human display name, such as
`Content Keys`.

`ChattoCore.Run` starts one process-local ordered EVT consumer per registered
projection. Each projector owns its physical filters, replay progress, failure
state, and readiness. Chatto still waits for every registered projection to
become current before completing boot. Writers wait for the relevant projector
sequence before returning read-your-writes.

Any non-cancellation error from checkpoint or snapshot restore, consumer setup,
or event application moves the projector into its failed state before its run
loop returns. Readiness and provider status therefore cannot remain
healthy-looking after an incomplete startup.

Projection consumers use a five-minute inactivity cleanup threshold. Because
event application is synchronous and disk-backed commits can temporarily stop
the pull loop, a shorter broker threshold could delete a live consumer while
its projection is still applying a batch. Projector shutdown still stops the
pull subscription; NATS later removes its ephemeral consumer.

The projector framework owns JetStream message handling and passes stable
stream sequence numbers into `Projection.Apply`. Projection implementations do
not inspect consumer sequence numbers or raw JetStream metadata. An optional
startup-batch capability groups only the replay through the target captured at
startup; live events continue through individual `Apply` calls.

Projections that require event-envelope idempotency keep event-ID sets only
through the captured startup target. Clean histories then release those sets
and use the highest applied stream sequence as a constant-size steady-state
guard. If startup replay observes a duplicate ID, only that projection retains
its set and first-event-wins compatibility behaviour. Projection diagnostics
report both retained event-ID memory and whether compatibility mode is active.

## Local checkpoint support

The projector framework also supports a projection-owned local checkpoint.
The checkpoint contract binds the derived state and its highest atomically
applied EVT sequence to a stable projection key, a projection contract ID, and
the current EVT stream incarnation and retained sequence bounds. A valid
checkpoint replays only the remaining EVT tail. Its global stream cutoff may
be newer than the last event matching the projection's current filters; only a
cutoff beyond the EVT stream tail is a future checkpoint.

A projection uses at most one restore authority: ADR-050 snapshots, a local
checkpoint, or neither. A projection without either starts empty and cold-replays
`EVT`. Missing, corrupt, incompatible, future, or retention-gapped checkpoints
are invalid; the projection may safely reset owned state or fail startup for
operator recovery. A successful individual `Apply` or startup batch must
atomically commit its derived changes and supplied final stream sequence.

The bundled search provider owns the first locally checkpointed projection. It
is registered by its runtime unit rather than by `ChattoCore`. It consumes only
message body, message posting, message retraction, room deletion, user DEK
generation, and user key shredding event families, and uses projector key
`message_search`. During captured startup replay it commits up to 256 ordered
events and the final checkpoint in one Bleve transaction, including a smaller
final batch; once current, each relevant live event is committed immediately.
Its checkpoint contract starts with `bleve-message-index-v8-` and includes a
stable fingerprint of the configured language analyzer set, so changing that
set forces a cold EVT replay.

The index stores current decrypted message text plus its body-event revision and
message/room/author/filter metadata. The state needed to apply a later edit or
posting event is a stored, non-indexed field in that same Bleve document; it is
not duplicated as one internal Bolt key per message. Candidate revisions must
match current core state before hydration, fencing provider catch-up races.

Message bodies use BM25 scoring over a language-neutral field plus the
operator-selected subset of all 22 complete language analyzers available in
the bundled Bleve version. Omitting `search_provider.languages` selects all
analyzers; an explicit empty list selects none of the language-specific fields.
The index also stores non-plaintext DEK event metadata required to decrypt
later EVT tail records after restart. Retraction, room deletion, and user key
shredding remove matching documents in the same committed batch. Bleve's normal
background merger reclaims obsolete segments; Chatto does not use Scorch's
manual `ForceMerge` operation as part of projection correctness or startup
readiness.

The directory is a privileged, disposable local cache excluded from Chatto
backups. Chatto creates it only when the configured path does not exist and
never recursively deletes an unreadable or incompatible disk index. Those
conditions fail provider startup; an operator must move or delete the dedicated
directory explicitly before restarting it for a cold EVT replay.

## Snapshot support

`core.projection_snapshots` enables ADR-050 encrypted projection snapshots.
Every eligible projection owns one opaque, projection-scoped contract ID and
generation prefix. The contract covers serialized state, replay semantics,
consumed event families, and cutoff meaning. Most contracts currently use
`v1`; the user profile contract uses `v2`.

Snapshot loads and replay frontiers are projection-local. A successful restore
starts that projection's ordered consumer at one greater than its cutoff. A
missing, invalid, or unavailable snapshot cold-replays only its owning
projection. Projections without matching EVT history have no state to
accelerate and do not publish zero-cutoff generations. Credential-bearing user
state is owned by `UserAuthProjection` and cold-replays from eight focused user
event families.

The projector framework atomically captures each projection's explicit
protobuf state with its latest applied logical EVT sequence. Room Timeline
retains encrypted body envelopes and rebuilds derived indexes. Mentionables
retains encrypted login source events and wrapped DEK records rather than
plaintext handles or lookup digests. The Users codec retains encrypted login,
display-name, and verified-email values, lookup digests, wrapped DEK records,
and non-secret profile metadata. Its schema has no fields for password verifiers,
authentication generations, external identity subjects, or OAuth consent.

Every replica checks snapshot eligibility immediately after boot and hourly.
Each scheduled pass attempts the `MEMORY_CACHE` lease once; a winner runs jobs
sequentially and releases the lease before the hourly wait. The worker publishes
after cold or delta replay and refreshes unchanged generations once they reach
23 hours old. Repository OCC remains the correctness boundary for staggered or
stale writers.

S3 expiry uses a separate `MEMORY_CACHE` cooldown claim shared by all replicas.
The first elected pass after the cooldown expires runs bounded cleanup and keeps
the claim for 24 hours on success. Failures release it for an hourly retry.

Generations are compressed and authenticated with XChaCha20-Poly1305 under an
HKDF key derived from `core.secret_key`, then stored under
`internal/projection-snapshots/{projection}/{contract}/objects/{opaqueEpoch}/{generationId}`
in the dedicated NATS `PROJECTION_SNAPSHOTS` Object Store or configured S3
bucket. Their encrypted current/previous pointers live in `RUNTIME_STATE` and
use KV revision OCC regardless of payload backend. The opaque pointer locator
is scoped by projection and contract, so deployments using different contracts
cannot read, rotate, or compare each other's generations.

A new secret uses a different generation epoch and pointer locator. EVT carries
a versioned opaque incarnation ID so snapshot validation survives process
reconstruction and backup restore but changes when EVT is recreated.

`core.projection_snapshot_retention` defaults to seven days. NATS applies it as
the Object Store TTL. S3 uses a bounded age-expiry pass after daily publication
unless `core.projection_snapshot_s3_cleanup` is disabled for an external
lifecycle policy. S3 deletion requires the exact generation-key grammar,
expected snapshot content type, and private object-purpose marker. Snapshot and
expiry failures are logged and never affect core readiness or EVT-backed
reconstruction. Legacy cohort paths remain outside application S3 expiry.

Registered projector keys are used by metrics and automation. Registered names
match the admin projection diagnostics. Composite projections expose nested
read models, but only their parent projector is started by `ChattoCore.Run`.
Custom Emojis and Soundboard currently cold-replay their small server-wide
catalogs and do not publish projection snapshots.

Independent consumers isolate snapshot availability, replay cost, status, lag,
failure, and read-your-writes waiters per projection. `Subjects()` is the
logical consumption and readiness contract; optional replay subjects are the
projection-owned physical consumer filters.

Focused logical filters suit stable derived indexes such as Threads. Broad
filters remain intentional for projections whose snapshots expose room-tail
OCC positions, such as Reactions and Call State. Threads reports the focused
logical subjects above for waits and diagnostics; non-thread room facts are
skipped before `Apply`.

Room Timeline and Threads physically replay through one `evt.>` filter. Their
logical room and key-shredding subjects still determine readiness and
application. The projector rejects other subjects before protobuf decoding.
This avoids JetStream's expensive multi-filter scan for a broad room wildcard
combined with a sparse user event while preserving independent consumers and
projection-local replay frontiers.

`UserProjection` retains encrypted user fields and their AAD metadata. The user
and mentionable projections decrypt login and email values only transiently
while applying events to derive in-memory lookup digests; neither plaintext nor
the digests are persisted in `EVT`. Read hydration decrypts profile PII with
request-scoped DEK reuse. KMS and decryption failures remain operational errors
rather than appearing as missing or deleted users.
`UserAuthProjection` is independently locked, registered, and replay-guarded.
The `UserProjection` facade delegates credential and external-identity reads to
it so API callers keep one user boundary while snapshot serialization cannot
reach authentication state.
