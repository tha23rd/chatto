| Republish    | `live.evt.>`        | None    | No     | Raw committed `EVT` facts republished by JetStream for server-side live delivery |

## Durable consumers

| Stream | Consumer | Filter | Ack contract | Owner |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------------ | ----- |
| `EVT` | `chatto-asset-processing-v1` | `evt.asset.*.asset_processing_started`, legacy `evt.room.*.asset_processing_started` | Explicit ack after a terminal asset outcome is projected; interrupted work is redelivered | Shared `asset-processing` runtime-unit replicas |
| `EVT` | `chatto-user-key-shredding-v1` | `evt.user.*.user_key_shredding_requested` | Explicit ack after idempotent key deletion and projected `UserKeyShreddedEvent`; interrupted or failed work is redelivered | Shared `ChattoCore` replicas |
| `EVT` | `chatto-call-key-cleanup-v1` | `evt.room.*.call_ended` | Explicit ack after idempotent call-key shredding; interrupted or failed work is redelivered | Shared `ChattoCore` replicas |
| `EVT` | `chatto-asset-cleanup-v1` | `evt.asset.*.asset_deleted` | Explicit ack after idempotent binary and transform-cache deletion; interrupted or failed work is redelivered | Shared `ChattoCore` replicas |

All consumers use file-backed durable consumer state inherited from `EVT` and
do not introduce separate work streams. Replaying older facts is safe:
asset-processing workers acknowledge projected terminal outcomes, while
key-shredding and cleanup workers repeat idempotent deletion; user-key workers
additionally acknowledge an existing physical-completion fact.

The consumer names are versioned persisted resource contracts. Required effect
consumers have no inactivity cleanup and survive worker shutdown or
scale-to-zero; `EVT` backups include their consumer state. Chatto currently has
no retired durable effect consumers. A future removal or incompatible contract
change follows ADR-069's explicit drain, rollout, and deletion lifecycle.
If a required consumer disappears while its worker is running, the stale worker
returns an error. Main-app lifecycle replacement or the embedded runtime-unit
supervisor then recreates the declared consumer through its application-owned
configuration; the shared worker framework never creates it.

## EVT stream identity

`EVT` metadata key `chatto.evt.incarnation` stores a versioned identity with
the existing `evt-incarnation-v1:` format. Chatto creates the value from the
stream creation timestamp when metadata is missing, preserves it through
normal updates and backups, and changes it when the stream is recreated.
`internal/evtstream` is the application-owned authority for this metadata and
format. Projector restore resolves it from the same fresh stream-info snapshot
as the relevant sequence bounds; projection persistence treats the validated
result as opaque.
