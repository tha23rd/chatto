[ADR-034](../adr/ADR-034-single-event-stream.md), and
[ADR-036](../adr/ADR-036-runtime-state-kv-boundary.md).

Key and subject schemas are maintained separately in the
[runtime state](runtime-state.md) and [subject and event](subjects-and-events.md)
inventories.

## EVT stream identity

`EVT` metadata key `chatto.evt.incarnation` stores a versioned identity with
the existing `evt-incarnation-v1:` format. Chatto creates the value from the
stream creation timestamp when metadata is missing, preserves it through
normal updates and backups, and changes it when the stream is recreated.
`internal/evtstream` is the application-owned authority for this metadata and
format. Projector restore resolves it from the same fresh stream-info snapshot
as the relevant sequence bounds; projection persistence treats the validated
result as opaque.
