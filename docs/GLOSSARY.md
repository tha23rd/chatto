# Glossary

The canonical vocabulary for Chatto: UI surfaces, product concepts, authorization terms, and backend infrastructure. One line per entry (occasionally one short paragraph) — just enough to recognize the word and know where to read more.

This document is **also a naming surface**: when we need a name for a thing we're building, we add it here first. That's how vocabulary stays consistent across code, UI, docs, and conversation.

This is **not** a tutorial, design doc, or API reference. If a concept needs more than a paragraph, link to the relevant [FDR](fdr/INDEX.md), [ADR](adr/INDEX.md), [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and directory-specific `AGENTS.md` files, or [architecture inventory](architecture/INDEX.md) rather than inlining.

Entries within each section are ordered by **conceptual flow** — foundational terms first, derivatives after — not alphabetically. See [`.agents/skills/glossary/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/glossary/SKILL.md) for the maintenance workflow.

## UI

Names for visible surfaces and component groupings. When a name here disagrees with a file or component name in the codebase, the glossary wins — the file is the one that should rename.

**Application Header** — Global bar across the top of the client. Client-wide navigation, notifications, and meta controls live on the left; the active server's message of the day occupies the centre; version and session controls live on the right. Implemented in `apps/frontend/src/lib/ui/AppHeader.svelte`.

**Server Gutter** — Narrow leftmost column listing the user's servers, with the add-server button at the bottom. Metaphor borrowed from the gutter in a text editor: a thin marginal strip. Implemented in `apps/frontend/src/lib/ServerGutter.svelte`.

**Server Sidebar** — The wider sidebar to the right of the Server Gutter, scoped to a single server. Owns the per-server pane's chrome (positioning, mobile slide, resize, current-user bar pinned to bottom). The actual contents are passed in by `Chrome.svelte` — typically the server banner + header + room list, or the settings/admin nav while those modes are active. Implemented in `apps/frontend/src/lib/components/ServerSidebar.svelte`.

**Room View** — The main central area showing the current room: message list plus the composer at the bottom. Not "the chat area" — *Room View* is the canonical name.

**Room Sidebar** — Right-hand pane scoped to the current room. Hosts room-specific extras such as the member list today and future surfaces like files or calls. Implemented in `apps/frontend/src/routes/chat/[serverId]/[roomId]/RoomSidebar.svelte`.

**Composer** — The message input at the bottom of the Room View. Includes text input, attachment picker, emoji picker, mentions autocomplete.

**Pane Header** — The top bar of a content pane (Room View, settings page, admin page, etc.). Carries the title, optional subtitle, optional back arrow, and icon-only action buttons via the `actions` snippet. Chunky labelled buttons belong in the body, not here. See [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

**Quick Switcher** — Cmd-K / Ctrl-K palette for jumping between rooms, DMs, servers, and admin pages. Distinct from the Server Gutter — both let you change server, but the Quick Switcher is keyboard-first and searchable. See [FDR-015](fdr/FDR-015-quick-switcher.md).

**Slideover** — A pane that slides in over existing content (e.g. settings, thread view on mobile). Distinct from a modal: dismissable by navigation, not by an explicit close.

**Hint** — Inline informational callout used in admin/settings panels to introduce or contextualise a control. Use instead of nesting an outer Panel around a self-contained matrix.

**Panel** — Bordered card used across instance-admin (`/chat/[serverId]/admin/*`) and per-server settings pages. Shared visual chrome for administrative interfaces. See [`cli/AGENTS.md`](../cli/AGENTS.md).

## Product

User-facing concepts. If a user might say the word, it goes here.

**Server** — Top-level Chatto deployment: one process, one NATS account, one membership boundary. Formerly called *Instance* in the codebase. See [ADR-029](adr/ADR-029-instance-to-server-rename.md).

**Space** — Legacy tier between server and room. Being consolidated into the server concept; in most deployments there is exactly one space per server (the *primary space*). See [ADR-027](adr/ADR-027-instance-space-server-consolidation.md).

**Primary Space** — Transitional config-designated "the one space that matters" within a server. Bridge construct used while Instance + Space collapse into Server. See [ADR-027](adr/ADR-027-instance-space-server-consolidation.md).

**Room** — A channel or DM. Where messages live. Identified by `(serverId, roomId)`.

**Universal room** — Channel room that behaves as joined for every server member currently eligible to join it, without writing per-user membership events. See [FDR-019](fdr/FDR-019-room-lifecycle.md).

**Room Group** — Named collection of rooms within a server, with its own per-group permission overrides. See [ADR-031](adr/ADR-031-room-group-centric-acl.md) and [FDR-017](fdr/FDR-017-room-groups-and-sidebar-layout.md).

**Sidebar Link** — Operator-managed link shown in the Server Sidebar inside a Room Group, ordered alongside rooms and stored as a durable group aggregate fact. See [FDR-017](fdr/FDR-017-room-groups-and-sidebar-layout.md).

**DM (Direct Message)** — Private conversation between users, modelled as a room with `kind: dm`. See [FDR-007](fdr/FDR-007-direct-messages.md).

**Message** — A user-posted entry in a room. Root messages live at the top level; thread replies hang off a root.

**Thread** — Reply chain rooted at a message. See [FDR-002](fdr/FDR-002-replies-and-threads.md).

**Echo** — Reposting a thread reply back to its parent channel so non-thread participants see it. Gated by `message.echo`. See [FDR-003](fdr/FDR-003-thread-reply-echo.md).

**Reaction** — Emoji attached to a message by a user; the emoji can be a built-in gemoji or a server *Custom Emoji*. See [FDR-005](fdr/FDR-005-reactions.md).

**Custom Emoji** — Admin-uploaded, named image shortcode (for example `:partyparrot:`) in a server-wide catalog that any member can use. Names match `^[a-z0-9_]{1,64}$` and must not collide with built-in gemoji shortcodes. In its first version custom emoji are usable as message *Reactions* (rendered as images); inline `:name:` substitution in message bodies is out of scope. Managed with `server.manage`. See [FDR-900](fdr/FDR-900-custom-emoji.md).

**Channel Webhook** — Per-room, token-authorized HTTP endpoint that lets an external service post messages without a user account or session, mirroring Discord's incoming webhooks. Created and managed with `server.manage`; the secret post URL is shown once at creation/regeneration and never again. Posts may override the display name/avatar per message. See [FDR-902](fdr/FDR-902-channel-webhooks.md).

**Mention** — `@handle` syntax in a message that notifies referenced users, pingable roles, or virtual room groups such as `@all` and `@here`. See [FDR-006](fdr/FDR-006-mentions.md).

**Attachment** — File (image, document, video) uploaded alongside a message. See [FDR-008](fdr/FDR-008-file-attachments-and-video.md).

**Link Preview** — Auto-generated preview card for URLs in messages. See [FDR-009](fdr/FDR-009-link-previews.md).

**Typing Indicator** — Ephemeral "X is typing…" signal. Published as a live event, never persisted. See [FDR-010](fdr/FDR-010-typing-indicators.md).

**Presence** — A user's online/away/offline state. See [FDR-011](fdr/FDR-011-user-presence.md).

**Voice Call** — Real-time audio call attached to a room. See [FDR-016](fdr/FDR-016-voice-calls.md).

**Jump to Present** — UI affordance that returns the Room View to the latest message after scrolling back through history. See [FDR-014](fdr/FDR-014-jump-to-present.md).

**Last-Room Memory** — The system that remembers which room a user was last in per-server. See [FDR-026](fdr/FDR-026-last-room-memory.md).

## Authorization

Chatto's RBAC model. Read top-to-bottom — terms build on each other.

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** — The model: roles bundle permissions, users hold roles, and direct user decisions can grant or deny exceptions. See [ADR-040](adr/ADR-040-permission-only-rbac-with-owner-override.md) and [ADR-052](adr/ADR-052-subject-specific-rbac-with-everyone-baseline.md).

**Role** — Named bundle of permissions, assignable to users. System roles are seeded; custom roles can be created. Role names share the message-mention namespace with user logins, and each role can be marked pingable to allow `@role` pings.

**Permission** — Named capability gate, e.g. `message.post`, `role.assign`. Strings use hyphens, never underscores. The full list lives in `cli/internal/core/permission.go`.

**Protocol capability** — Key a server advertises in `ServerCompatibility.protocol_capabilities` to state which wire contracts it implements, e.g. `chatto.role-colors.v1`. Describes protocol support only — never server configuration or a viewer's permissions. This distribution uses them for protocol features no upstream release carries; features that do exist upstream are gated on the server release version instead.

**Position** — Numeric display/order value for a role. `everyone` = 0, `moderator` = 100, `admin` = 900, `owner` = 1000. Custom roles slot in the gaps. Position is not an authorization rank.

**Effective owner** — A user who either has the durable `owner` role or has a verified email listed in `owners.emails`. Effective owners receive every known RBAC permission virtually. DM contents remain protected by participation checks at the API boundary.

**Owner** — Top system role (position 1000). Conferred through role assignment or through verified `owners.emails` configuration.

**Admin** — System role (position 900). Broad administrative defaults, still subject to explicit RBAC decisions unless the user is also an effective owner.

**Moderator** — System role (position 100). Moderation permissions, no administrative reach.

**Everyone** — Implicit virtual role (position 0) held by every authenticated user. Its nearest decision is the scoped permission baseline. A direct-user or named-role allow overrides an `everyone` deny only at the same or a nearer scope; a named/direct deny always wins.

**Scope** — Tier at which a permission is configured: `server`, `group`, or `room`. Each direct user or named role contributes only its nearest explicit decision (room, then group, then server). Denies win across those subject decisions; an allow must be at least as specific as an `everyone` deny to override the baseline. See [`cli/AGENTS.md`](../cli/AGENTS.md).

**User-level decision** — Permission grant or deny attached directly to a user, not via a role. It participates alongside named-role decisions, so a user deny blocks named-role grants while a named-role deny blocks a user grant. Used for suspensions and ad-hoc grants.

**DM Privacy Boundary** — Static set of channel-style permissions (`message.manage`, `message.echo`, `room.manage`, …) denied to non-owners inside DM rooms regardless of role grants. DM read access comes from room membership, not a separate read permission, so ownership does not grant access to other people's DM contents. See [ADR-037](adr/ADR-037-dm-access-via-membership.md).

## Backend

Infrastructure jargon. If only contributors say the word, it goes here.

**ChattoCore** — Go package (`cli/internal/core`) that owns domain models, projections, and NATS access. Low-level helpers are not public transport entry points and may assume their caller has already authorized the operation; public ConnectRPC paths should delegate to core operation models that own authorization before domain state changes. See [ADR-044](adr/ADR-044-connectrpc-service-conventions.md).

**System actor** — Synthetic actor ID used when Chatto itself, bootstrap code, or trusted operator automation performs a domain write. It is not a login-capable user account.

**Webhook user** — Synthetic, non-human user of kind `USER_KIND_WEBHOOK` that backs a *Channel Webhook* and authors its messages. Passwordless and excluded from the member directory, login resolution, and mention autocomplete. See [FDR-902](fdr/FDR-902-channel-webhooks.md).

**Admin API** — Public ConnectRPC administrative surface in `chatto.admin.v1`. On the public web listener it uses normal user authentication and RBAC. It is separate from the local Operator API. See [FDR-028](fdr/FDR-028-operator-api-and-cli.md).

**Operator API** — Root-equivalent local ConnectRPC surface in `chatto.operator.v1`, served only on the configured Unix socket. Socket filesystem permissions are the access boundary; anyone who can connect to the socket can perform operator actions as the system actor. See [FDR-028](fdr/FDR-028-operator-api-and-cli.md).

**Operator socket** — Unix socket configured by `[operator_api].socket_path` / `CHATTO_OPERATOR_API_SOCKET_PATH`. `chatto operator ...` uses it to send root-equivalent commands to the already-running Chatto process without opening a second store writer.

**NATS** — Messaging system Chatto uses for pubsub and persistence. Runs embedded in the single binary by default.

**JetStream** — NATS's persistence layer (streams + KV buckets). Chatto's primary data store. See [ADR-001](adr/ADR-001-nats-jetstream-as-primary-data-store.md).

**Stream** — JetStream append-only log. Chatto's event-sourcing stream is `EVT`, which stores durable domain facts. See [ADR-033](adr/ADR-033-event-sourced-state-with-projections.md) and the [NATS resource inventory](architecture/nats-resources.md).

**KV (Key-Value Bucket)** — JetStream-backed key/value store. Chatto uses several current buckets, especially `RUNTIME_STATE`, `MEMORY_CACHE`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEYS`; event-sourced domain state is sourced from `EVT`. See [ADR-033](adr/ADR-033-event-sourced-state-with-projections.md).

**Subject** — NATS message topic. Current durable facts use `evt.{aggregateType}.{aggregateId}.{eventType}`; transient sync uses `live.sync.…`; committed EVT facts are internally republished on `live.evt.…`. See [`cli/AGENTS.md`](../cli/AGENTS.md) and the [subject and event inventory](architecture/subjects-and-events.md#evt-subject-patterns).

**Event** — Durable domain fact stored on `EVT` using the `corev1.Event` wrapper. Contrast with *Live Event*.

**Projection** — Derived read model rebuilt from `EVT` and owned independently by each consuming process. Persistence is optional: a projection may cold-replay every time, use an encrypted snapshot, or checkpoint a disposable local index and EVT cutoff for tail replay. `EVT` remains the source of truth. See [ADR-033](adr/ADR-033-event-sourced-state-with-projections.md) and [ADR-054](adr/ADR-054-optional-projection-persistence.md).

**Auth generation** — Per-user authentication epoch derived from durable user events. Cookie sessions, bearer tokens, and OAuth authorization codes are valid only when their stored generation matches the user's current generation. See [FDR-023](fdr/FDR-023-authentication-and-sessions.md).

**External identity** — Provider-issued account identity linked to a user, keyed by verified issuer/provider namespace plus provider subject rather than email. See [FDR-023](fdr/FDR-023-authentication-and-sessions.md).

**Live Event** — Internal `corev1.LiveEvent` signal published on `live.sync.>` for ephemeral activity and latest-value invalidation. The server may expose a genuinely transient signal such as typing or presence through `RealtimeEventEnvelope`, or use the signal to assemble an authoritative `RealtimeProjectionOperation`; the internal shape is never the public contract. Durable EVT facts reach live subscribers through `live.evt.>` after server-side projection readiness and authorization checks. See [ADR-051](adr/ADR-051-server-scoped-resumable-client-projection.md).

**Client Projection** — Authenticated, server-scoped current state delivered by realtime protocol 2. Compacted bootstrap, resumable replay, live mutation, and lazy room hydration all use the same ordered projection operations and reducer. It is a convergence feed rather than an audit log and does not replace the resource-oriented `chatto.api.v1` integrations API. See [ADR-051](adr/ADR-051-server-scoped-resumable-client-projection.md).

**Republish** — JetStream feature that mirrors accepted stream messages onto another NATS subject. Chatto uses it to expose committed EVT facts on `live.evt.>`; `myEvents` treats that as an internal feed, not a client contract. See [`cli/AGENTS.md`](../cli/AGENTS.md).

**OCC (Optimistic Concurrency Control)** — Publishing with an expected stream sequence so concurrent writers don't clobber each other. Used for message posting. See [ADR-016](adr/ADR-016-occ-for-message-publishing.md).

**Nanoid** — Short URL-safe unique ID format. All Chatto entities are prefixed (`usr_…`, `rm_…`, `srv_…`). See [ADR-022](adr/ADR-022-nanoid-with-entity-prefixes.md).

**Crypto-shredding** — Deleting a user's data by destroying the app-owned DEK refs and KMS wrapping-key refs that protect their encrypted content rather than mutating storage. See [ADR-007](adr/ADR-007-per-user-encryption-with-crypto-shredding.md).
