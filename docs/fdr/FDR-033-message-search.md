# FDR-033: Message Search

**Status:** Experimental
**Last reviewed:** 2026-07-31

## Overview

Authenticated users can search message history on one Chatto server and open a
matching message in its original room or thread context. Search is an optional
server feature: operators decide whether to expose it and which trusted search
provider supplies results.

## Behavior

- Search covers the current bodies of messages in rooms the viewer may
  currently read, including direct messages, threads, and accessible archived
  rooms.
- The Search API and dedicated Search page apply to one server. Prefixing a
  quick-switcher query with `?` makes the client query every compatible,
  available registered server and merge their top results by provider score.
- Plain words are combined as required terms. Quoted text searches for an exact
  phrase, and an explicit `AND` is accepted between terms.
- Relevance favours literal word matches while adding lower-ranked recall from
  the operator-selected Bleve language analyzers, CJK token matching when its
  analyzer is selected, and conservative one-character spelling mistakes in
  longer words. The bundled provider enables all analyzers by default.
- Structured filters support a room (`in:`), author (`from:`), messages before
  or after a date, and messages with attachments. Any recognized filter can be
  used on its own without an additional word or phrase.
- Search is available as a server-level page reached from the server sidebar
  between Overview and My Threads, and as a room-sidebar tab that searches only
  the current room or direct-message conversation.
- Both entry points search automatically after a short typing pause, while
  Enter submits immediately. Leading or trailing whitespace is ignored for
  search requests without replacing the text in the field or repeating an
  otherwise identical search.
- Each registered server retains its own transient server-wide query, ordering,
  and result state. Recently used rooms also retain separate transient sidebar
  search state. Switching servers or rooms never carries plaintext results into
  a different scope; returning to a retained scope can restore its previous
  search.
- Results show the current message, author, room, and timestamp. The bundled
  client requests 50 at a time, loads more automatically, and can order them by
  relevance or newest first. Pagination reads the live provider index rather
  than a pinned snapshot, so results may shift while indexing continues.
- Selecting a result opens the message in its historical room or thread context
  using the normal jumped-mode navigation.
- Edits replace searchable content. Retracted, deleted, unavailable, or
  crypto-shredded bodies do not appear in results.
- Search is absent when the server feature is disabled. A configured provider
  that is still indexing or temporarily unavailable produces an explicit
  status without making the rest of the server unusable.
- Public readiness is deliberately coarse. Exact event-log indexing counts and
  rates remain operator telemetry rather than being exposed to every member.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Server-local search supports a client-federated shortcut

**Decision:** The public API remains server-local. The dedicated page offers
the full server-scoped search experience, while a `?` quick-switcher query
fans out to all compatible registered servers for fast navigation.
**Why:** The client owns its server registry and can degrade gracefully when
one server is unavailable. Keeping federation out of the server API avoids a
new trust and identity boundary, while the dedicated page still has room for
filters, ordering, pagination, and extended reading.
**Tradeoff:** The palette requests only a small top slice from each server and
does not expose the dedicated page's filters or pagination.

### 2. Current visibility is authoritative

**Decision:** Results are limited to rooms the viewer may currently read, and
each result is checked again against current message state before delivery.
**Why:** A derived search index must never preserve access after membership or
content visibility changes. Search cannot become an alternative path around
the room privacy boundary.
**Tradeoff:** Authorization and hydration add work after text matching, and
stale provider hits may be discarded before a page is returned.

### 3. Only current message bodies are searchable

**Decision:** Editing a message replaces its indexed text instead of preserving
searchable edit history.
**Why:** Normal message reads expose the current body, so returning historical
text would be surprising and could reveal content the author removed. See
FDR-004.
**Tradeoff:** Search is not an edit-history or moderation-audit tool.

### 4. Search availability is negotiated independently

**Decision:** Public protocol support, operator feature enablement, provider
startup topology, and temporary provider readiness are separate states.
**Why:** A bundled or external provider may run independently from the main
app. Mixed-version clients need a stable support signal, while temporary
provider failure should degrade only Search. See ADR-041, ADR-045, and ADR-053.
**Tradeoff:** The API and client handle more states than a permanently embedded
search implementation would require.

### 5. Full-text indexing is a privileged optional cache

**Decision:** A provider may decrypt message bodies into a local derived index
that is excluded from normal backups and can be rebuilt from retained `EVT`
history.
**Why:** Useful server-side full-text search requires a plaintext-derived
representation even though durable message bodies remain encrypted. Bleve
logically removes retracted and crypto-shredded documents immediately and
reclaims their immutable segments through normal background merging. Operators
who require stronger physical-erasure guarantees must protect or explicitly
rebuild the index volume. See ADR-007, ADR-033, ADR-054, and ADR-055.
**Tradeoff:** Enabling Search expands the trusted server-side data surface and
requires operators to protect the provider volume.

### 6. One canonical query language fronts every provider

**Decision:** Chatto defines and parses the user-facing query syntax before
issuing normalized provider requests. A recognized structured filter is a
complete query even when no message-body term accompanies it.
**Why:** Query syntax, required-term semantics, and filters should remain stable
when an operator replaces Bleve with another provider, and third-party clients
should not need to emit a backend-specific query language.
**Tradeoff:** Recall and ranking may still vary by provider because analysis
features such as stemming and typo tolerance are implementation details.
Filter-only relevance has no body-text signal, so deterministic recency and ID
tie-breakers decide otherwise equal results.

### 7. Server-wide Search has a dedicated page

**Decision:** Search across rooms lives in the server sidebar and opens as a full
page rather than a modal or part of the quick switcher. Like room-scoped Search,
it submits after a short typing pause without requiring an action button.
**Why:** Searching message history is an extended reading task whose query,
results, filters, and future conversation context need durable screen space.
Debounced submission keeps the interaction immediate without issuing a request
for every keystroke.
**Tradeoff:** Opening a result leaves the Search page; each server's transient
search is retained in memory so browser Back can restore it. Pausing while
typing can submit an intermediate query, while Enter remains available for an
immediate search.

### 8. Providers return relevance scores

**Decision:** Each authorized public result carries the raw relevance score
returned by the search provider. The bundled client sorts cross-server palette
results by that value without calculating its own score.
**Why:** The provider has the index statistics and query model that produced
the ranking. Preserving its score avoids round-robin interleaving and avoids
inventing a weaker client-side relevance model.
**Tradeoff:** Scores from different provider implementations may not be
comparable. The initial 0.5 design optimizes for the bundled Bleve provider;
federation-wide calibration can be added later if implementation diversity
makes it necessary.

### 9. Room search stays beside the conversation

**Decision:** The room-sidebar Search tab always applies the current room as its
scope, including when the room is a direct-message conversation.
**Why:** People searching while reading a conversation usually want local
context and should not need to construct or clear an `in:` filter. Keeping the
results beside the timeline also makes it quick to inspect several matches in
the same conversation.
**Tradeoff:** Server-wide and room-scoped Search are two entry points with
independent transient query state.
