# FDR-024: Permission Inspection Tool

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-07-19

## Overview

Admins can inspect why a specific user has (or doesn't have) a permission, at server or room scope. The tool surfaces each direct-user and role decision that contributes to the check, with the winning decision highlighted. It's the only way to debug "why can this user post in #announcements?" without reading code.

## Behavior

- The admin UI exposes a "Permission Explainer" tool: pick a user, optionally pick a room, pick a permission, and see the full resolution trace.
- The ConnectRPC permission-inspection API keeps the inspector in the RBAC tooling namespace while preserving its admin/tooling-only authorization gate.
- The trace lists the nearest applicable (subject, scope) entry for the direct user and each assigned named role. It also includes the nearest `everyone` baseline entry.
- Denies win across direct-user and named-role entries. A named/direct allow wins over an `everyone` deny only at the same or a nearer scope; otherwise the nearer baseline row is marked as winning.
- Each trace entry shows: the subject (a role name, or "user" for user-level overrides), the scope (server / room group / room / user), the decided state (allow / deny / none), and whether this is the entry that won.
- If no role or override produced a decision, the resulting state is "none" — which the API boundary treats as deny by default.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Trace, not just final decision

**Decision:** The tool returns the complete set of effective subject entries, not just the boolean outcome. Less-specific entries shadowed by the same subject's nearer decision are omitted; the `everyone` baseline is retained so operators can see whether its scope applied.
**Why:** "Did the resolver allow this?" is a question the resolver itself answers. "Why?" requires showing the decision path so operators can spot misconfigurations — e.g., "this user gets `message.post` because their custom role has it granted at server scope, even though we denied it on `everyone`". A boolean wouldn't help debug a misconfig.
**Tradeoff:** Bigger response payloads. Acceptable for an admin tool that's used sparingly.

### 2. Admin-only, no self-inspection

**Decision:** Role inspection requires RBAC-editor authority (`role.manage`). User-level inspection requires `user.manage-permissions`. Regular users can't run the inspector unless they have one of those admin capabilities.
**Why:** The trace would leak which roles a user holds and the structure of the permission tree. Useful information to a malicious actor probing what they're up against. Restricting to admins keeps that surface inside the trust boundary.
**Tradeoff:** Users who legitimately wonder "why can't I post here?" have to ask an admin. Acceptable; the failure mode is rare and the leak is real.

### 3. Probe-resistant error responses

**Decision:** When inspecting a room scope, a missing or inaccessible room returns `ErrPermissionDenied`, not a 404 "room not found".
**Why:** A 404 leaks the existence-or-not of room IDs to anyone with access to the inspector. The permission-denied response is identical for "no such room" and "you can't see this room", so admins can't accidentally enumerate rooms via the tool.
**Tradeoff:** Slightly more confusing UX in the rare case where the admin actually mistyped a room ID. The admin UI suppresses this by populating the room ID from a dropdown of rooms they can see.

### 4. Same resolver code path as runtime permission checks

**Decision:** The explainer calls `core.PermResolver().ExplainAllPermissions(...)` — the same resolver used in production permission checks, but in a mode that records each step instead of short-circuiting.
**Why:** A separate "documentation" version of the resolver would drift from the real one. Anytime the real resolver gets a new short-circuit, optimization, or scope, the documentation version would be wrong until someone remembered to update it. Shared code = the trace is always the truth.
**Tradeoff:** The resolver has to support a "trace mode" that adds branching. The branching is small and well-isolated.

### 5. Trace surfaces scope tokens that match the UI

**Decision:** Trace entries label scopes as `SERVER`, `GROUP`, and `ROOM`, mirroring what the admin UI displays and the `PermissionScope` constants used by the resolver.
**Why:** Operators reading the trace shouldn't have to translate between internal vocabulary (e.g., "phase 2 of the resolver", "object ID 'any'") and what they see in the admin UI. The labels match the buttons.
**Tradeoff:** None — the API enum, the Go `Level*` constants, and the inspector UI use the same three tokens.

## Permissions

- `role.manage` — server-scope and room-scope inspection.
