# FDR-005: Reactions

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-10

## Overview

Users can react to a message with emoji. Reactions are aggregated into pills shown below the message body, displaying the emoji, a count, and whether the current user has reacted. Multiple users can react with the same emoji on the same message; clicking a pill toggles the current user's vote.

## Behavior

- Each pill shows: the emoji, how many users reacted with it, and a highlight when the current user has reacted.
- Hovering a pill shows a tooltip with up to 5 reactor names plus an overflow count.
- Clicking a pill toggles the current user's reaction.
- A user can add up to 20 distinct emoji reactions to one message. Reaching the limit rolls back the attempted reaction and shows a specific explanation; removing a reaction frees a slot.
- On desktop, hovering a message reveals a quick-reaction bar with the user's most recently used emojis (falling back to a default set if none have been used yet).
- Recent emoji selections persist in localStorage so the quick-bar stays personal across sessions.
- Reacting to someone else's message notifies its author unless they have muted the room. All reactions on one message collapse into a single pending notification; see FDR-012 for the collapse and count semantics.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Reactions key on canonical message event ID

**Decision:** A reaction is keyed by the canonical message event ID. For ordinary messages this is the visible event ID; for a channel echo of a thread reply, it is the original thread reply event ID. Echo event IDs remain accepted as aliases at API boundaries.
**Why:** The echo and original render the same contribution in different views. Sharing one reaction set keeps counts, viewer state, and reactor previews consistent wherever the reply appears.
**Tradeoff:** Reaction reads and replay need the room timeline's echo link to resolve aliases. Historical echo-keyed reaction facts are interpreted as reactions on the original reply without rewriting EVT.

### 2. Shortcodes, not raw Unicode

**Decision:** Reactions are stored as shortcode names like `thumbsup` or `heart`, drawn from the gemoji dataset (GitHub's emoji set). The frontend converts to display glyphs.
**Why:** NATS KV keys can't contain arbitrary Unicode, and storing the codepoint as a key would also lock us into one particular Unicode version's normalization rules. Shortcodes are stable, portable, and human-readable in storage.
**Tradeoff:** Emojis outside the gemoji set can't be used. The set is large enough that this rarely matters.

### 3. Durable events, in-memory projection is source of truth

**Decision:** Reaction add/remove changes append durable room-aggregate events to EVT (`evt.room.{roomId}.reaction_added` / `reaction_removed`). Current reaction state is derived by an in-memory projection keyed by canonical message event ID, emoji shortcode, and actor/user ID. The projection consumes the room aggregate namespace so mutation snapshots can pair current reaction state with the room's applied OCC sequence and so replay can resolve echo aliases from prior message facts. Live subscribers receive reactions through the EVT stream's `live.evt.>` republish path after projection readiness and authorization checks.
**Why:** Reactions are durable room facts. Keeping them in the room stream makes add/remove ordering explicit, gives replayable state, removes the old KV bucket from the hot read/write path, and lets duplicate add/remove decisions retry safely under multi-replica contention.
**Tradeoff:** The first projection version keeps all current reaction state in RAM and consumes more room facts than it derives. That is simple and correct; bounded or demand-loaded projections can follow once the rest of the event-sourcing architecture is in place and real access patterns are measured.

### 4. Public APIs expose reactor names as a bounded preview

**Decision:** `ReactionSummary.count` is the total current count, while bounded reactor previews expose only a small set of reacting users. ConnectRPC room timeline responses expose hydrated reaction summaries with bounded preview semantics. Reaction writes use ConnectRPC `MessageService.AddReaction` and `RemoveReaction` in the web client and call the shared core operation model.
**Why:** Reaction pills need a quick hover tooltip, not an unbounded user directory embedded in every message event. Keeping the full count separate preserves the main signal while preventing popular reactions from inflating timeline payloads.
**Tradeoff:** Clients that need a complete reactor list will need a future dedicated paginated query instead of overloading the message timeline shape.

### 5. Quick-reaction recents are per-device, not per-user

**Decision:** The recent-reactions list lives in `localStorage`, not on the server.
**Why:** Server-side recents would mean a "your recents" query on every message hover (frequent and small) and a new write per reaction. Local storage is free and fast. The downside — losing recents between devices — is small relative to the cost.
**Tradeoff:** Recents don't sync across devices.

### 6. Web reconnect catch-up resumes the server projection

**Decision:** The web client retains current message windows for rooms after they are first viewed. Realtime reaction changes upsert the current message row, including aggregate reaction state, and carry the exact add/remove transition for retained rooms. A short socket gap resumes from the last in-memory cursor through the same projection reducer; a fresh or unsafe resume resets lightweight server state plus only the room windows the client still retains.
**Why:** Reactions mutate existing message rows, but eagerly hydrating every historical DM is disproportionate. A retained room still provides exact transition catch-up without a separate reaction-history query, while a never-viewed room starts from authoritative aggregate state when first opened.
**Tradeoff:** Integrators receive exact add/remove transitions only for room timelines they ask the stream to retain. A compacted reset and first hydration transmit current aggregate state rather than recreating historical transitions. Reactions on older messages remain available through ordinary timeline pagination because the stream is a convergence feed rather than an audit log.

For an echoed thread reply, the server emits authoritative upserts for both the
canonical reply and the visible channel echo. This keeps both renderings in
sync without requiring clients to infer echo linkage from a reaction signal.

### 7. Web client reaction clicks are optimistic

**Decision:** The web client applies add/remove reaction clicks to the visible message store immediately, then reconciles the touched emoji from the ConnectRPC response. The server remains authoritative: realtime projection upserts replace the local row with current aggregate state.
**Why:** Reaction clicks should feel instant without changing the durable event model or public API.
**Tradeoff:** Reactor-name tooltips are best-effort during the optimistic window and become exact after the projected row refresh.

### 8. Each user can add at most 20 reactions per message

**Decision:** One user may have at most 20 distinct emoji reactions on one canonical message. The cap applies equally to members, moderators, administrators, and owners. Historical messages that already exceed the cap keep all their reactions, but affected users cannot add another until removals bring them below the limit.
**Why:** A fixed upper bound prevents one account from creating an unbounded number of reaction facts or overwhelming the message UI while remaining generous for ordinary use. Applying the rule to the canonical message also prevents thread-reply echoes from becoming a second allowance.
**Tradeoff:** Operators cannot tune or bypass the limit. A future tier-aware configuration system can revisit that choice if communities demonstrate materially different needs.

### 9. Reaction authorization is request-time and room-scoped

**Decision:** Every user-facing add/remove attempt captures the room aggregate
tail, waits the projections used by membership, `message.react`, room state,
message aliasing, and reaction-limit decisions, and evaluates the complete
operation-level gate. A concurrent room change rejects the append and reruns
the decision. A cross-aggregate authorization change does not retroactively
cancel an already-authorized, otherwise conflict-free attempt.

**Why:** Reactions are low-risk, high-frequency room mutations. Request-time
authorization matches normal command semantics and avoids serializing reaction
traffic with every unrelated EVT fact. Room OCC still protects message
identity, archive state, duplicate state, and the per-user limit from stale
decisions.

**Tradeoff:** A revocation can commit immediately before a previously
authorized reaction commits. Subsequent attempts observe the new authorization
state. Operations that require revocation to win this in-flight race must opt
into a narrow commit-time authorization fence instead.
