# FDR-017: Room Groups & Sidebar Layout

**Status:** Active
**Last reviewed:** 2026-07-20

## Overview

Channel rooms are organized into **room groups** — named, ordered containers that act as both a UI grouping concept (collapsible sections in the sidebar) and the primary permission scope for room-level permissions. Every channel room belongs to exactly one group; DMs sit outside the group system entirely. Groups can also contain sidebar links: operator-managed links rendered in the same ordered sidebar section as rooms.

## Behavior

- The sidebar shows `room.list`-visible channel rooms and sidebar links grouped under their group's name in operator-defined order. Groups can be collapsed/expanded. A viewer with effective group `room.manage` also sees a settings action on that group header, including when no rooms in the group are otherwise visible.
- ConnectRPC `RoomDirectoryService.ListRoomGroups` exposes the same ordered sidebar structure for protobuf-first clients, filtering room entries to non-archived channel rooms visible to the viewer, preserving sidebar links, and reporting effective `room.create` and `room.manage` group capabilities in viewer state.
- Joined channel rooms behave as normal navigation entries. Listable channel rooms the viewer has not joined yet are shown slightly faded; selecting a joinable room asks for confirmation before joining, while selecting a non-joinable room explains that access is not currently available.
- Every visible room row exposes a context menu. Joined rooms offer unread and leave actions where applicable; non-member rooms offer Join, disabled when the viewer lacks `room.join`. Effective room `room.manage` holders also receive a settings action for channel rooms.
- Server-wide room managers can create and reorder groups from the room-layout overview. Its edit action opens the room group's resource page in the shared management area. Effective group `room.manage` holders can edit or delete that group, while either they or server-wide `role.manage` holders can configure its role permission matrix.
- Group names are limited to 80 bytes; group descriptions are limited to 500 bytes.
- Every channel room belongs to exactly one group. There's no "uncategorized" branch — room creation requires a group.
- Sidebar links belong to exactly one group, carry a label and either an absolute `http`/`https` URL or a server-local path starting with `/`, and are visible to authenticated users who can see the server sidebar.
- A freshly bootstrapped server has one group named "Lobby" containing the auto-created `announcements` and `general` rooms. Operators can rename it, reorder it, or replace it like any other group.
- Deleting a group is rejected while rooms or sidebar links still live in it. Operators move or delete its contents first.
- Moving a room between groups requires `room.manage` in both the source and the target group (the room's effective ACL changes overnight).
- Creating, editing, moving, deleting, or reordering sidebar links requires `room.manage` for the affected group. Moving a sidebar link between groups requires `room.manage` in both the source and target groups, matching room moves.
- Room-scope permissions (`message.post`, `room.join`, `message.react`, etc.) can be configured per group, with per-room overrides on top.
- Management-authorized group metadata reads are distinct from the user-facing room directory: `room.manage` and `role.manage` holders can load the selected group's settings even when they do not otherwise have room visibility. This read omits the group's ordered room/link entries so role permission managers do not gain private-room visibility through the settings page.

## Design Decisions

### 1. The room group is the primary permission container

**Decision:** Room-scope permissions are configured at the group level by default. A per-room override only changes the (role, permission) pairs explicitly overridden; everything else inherits from the group.
**Why:** Operators think in terms of room categories — "Engineering rooms work like X; off-topic rooms work like Y". Configuring permissions per category matches that mental model. Channel-centric ACLs (Discord-style) outperformed alternatives like ReBAC for chat's flat-ish structure. See ADR-031.
**Tradeoff:** A global tweak now requires editing every group. The admin UI surfaces an "apply to all groups" affordance to keep this ergonomic.

### 2. Per-room overrides are sparse, not full configurations

**Decision:** A room's permission config stores only the (subject, permission) pairs that differ from its group. For that same subject, a room decision replaces the group and server value; everything else inherits independently.
**Why:** Storing a full copy per room would multiply KV entries and make group-level tweaks awkward (every room would need to be touched). Sparse overrides keep the model both compact and operator-friendly.
**Tradeoff:** The permission resolver has to walk the inheritance chain (room → group → server) once per direct user or named role. Acceptable; the chain is short and cached.

### 3. Server scope cascades as a global default

**Decision:** When a subject's permission isn't decided at group or room scope, the resolver falls back to that subject's server decision. `everyone` supplies the scoped baseline: a named allow overrides an `everyone` deny only at the same or a nearer scope. This gives operators a single global default while letting a room/group baseline contain less-specific grants.
**Why:** Without server-scope cascade, every group would need a full set of grants from scratch — a worse onboarding experience and a worse story for DMs (which aren't in any group). The cascade restores a sensible default tier. See ADR-031.
**Tradeoff:** The ADR's headline "groups are the permission container" is slightly softer than it sounded — server scope still matters as a backstop. In practice operators rarely need to think about server scope unless they want a global default different from the seed.

### 4. Group deletion is non-cascading

**Decision:** A group with rooms or sidebar links in it can't be deleted. Operators must move every sidebar item out first.
**Why:** Cascading delete would be silent data loss in disguise — the operator might not realize rooms were tied to the group they're discarding. Forcing an explicit move makes the operator's intent unambiguous.
**Tradeoff:** A bit more UI work to "drain" a group before removing it. Worth it for the safety.

### 5. Moves require authorization in both ends

**Decision:** Moving a room or sidebar link from group A to group B requires `room.manage` in _both_ A and B. The UI previews affected users before confirming room moves.
**Why:** Moving across groups changes the effective permission set for everyone using the room. An admin authorized only in A shouldn't be able to dump rooms into B and grant a different audience access. Requiring both ends makes the privilege boundary symmetric.
**Tradeoff:** Operators with split responsibilities (group-of-groups admins) can't unilaterally rebalance — they need authorization on both sides. Considered correct: the operation is consequential. The write path uses a room-group projection snapshot plus `evt.group.>` OCC so concurrent moves retry from the current source group before appending the remove/add batch. User-authorized group/layout mutations also share the narrow authorization fence with RBAC changes, so a concurrent permission revocation forces the complete authorization check to rerun.

### 6. Sidebar links extend the existing group aggregate

**Decision:** Sidebar links are group-owned entries persisted as durable `evt.group.{groupId}.{eventType}` facts alongside room add/remove/reorder facts.
**Why:** The sidebar already reads group membership and order from the group aggregate. Keeping external links in that aggregate gives one ordered list of sidebar items without introducing a second layout store or a parallel permission model.
**Tradeoff:** A group reorder now talks about mixed sidebar entries rather than room IDs alone. The public API keeps room-specific operations and mixed-entry operations explicit for link-aware clients.

### 7. DMs are outside the group system

**Decision:** DM rooms don't belong to any group. Reading is governed by DM room membership; sending and starting DMs use message permissions; the hardcoded `dmBoundaryDeniedPermissions` list still prevents channel-style moderation inside DMs. Group concepts don't apply.
**Why:** DMs don't fit a "category of rooms" model — every DM is its own conversation. Trying to retrofit groups onto DMs would either need a synthetic "DMs" group (privilege concentration risk) or per-DM groups (meaningless). See ADR-031 and ADR-037.
**Tradeoff:** DMs keep a small policy branch outside the room-group model. That branch is about DM privacy and creation, not about read visibility.

### 8. Sidebar visibility follows room.list, not membership

**Decision:** Channel-room sidebar entries are based on `room.list` visibility and room-group layout, while membership only changes the row's presentation and action.
**Why:** Operators configure the sidebar through room groups. Showing all listable rooms makes that layout the user's map of the server, and lets users discover rooms before joining them.
**Tradeoff:** The sidebar can show rooms the viewer cannot enter yet. Those rows need clear affordances so discovery does not look like broken navigation.

### 9. Room directory reads are available over ConnectRPC

**Decision:** `RoomDirectoryService` is the protobuf-first read surface for room navigation: non-archived visible room lists, ordered room groups, mixed sidebar items, per-room viewer capability state, and the group join-all command.
**Why:** Clients need room/sidebar data around lifecycle commands. Keeping the directory read model in ConnectRPC lets clients render navigation and action affordances through one protobuf API surface.
**Tradeoff:** The service owns the room/sidebar visibility contract directly, so changes to room visibility must update the ConnectRPC mapping and tests.

## Permissions

- `room.create` — configured per group (or at server scope as a default).
- Server-scope `room.manage` — create and globally reorder room groups.
- Effective group `room.manage` — edit or delete a group and manage its sidebar entries; required in both source and target groups when moving a room or link.
- `role.manage` — configure role permission decisions at group scope without granting authority to change the group's general settings.
- `room.list` — controls whether a channel room appears in the sidebar and room directory for non-members.
- `room.join` — controls whether a non-member can join a visible channel room directly.
- All channel-room-scope permissions (`message.post`, `room.join`, etc.) are configurable per group with per-room overrides.
