# FDR-004: OpenID Connect Provider

**Status:** Experimental
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-01

## Overview

Authling acts as an OpenID Provider for conventional configured clients and
automatically discovered CIMD public clients. A person authenticates with
their Authling browser session, explicitly authorizes one request, and returns
to the relying party with an Authorization Code.

## Behavior

- Discovery is available at `/.well-known/openid-configuration`; public keys
  are published at the advertised JWKS endpoint.
- Authling advertises and accepts only Authorization Code. Every request
  requires `openid` and S256 PKCE, including confidential clients. A client may
  also request `account_data` for the access recorded in FDR-005.
- Redirect URI matching is exact. Authorization errors are sent to a client
  only after that client and redirect have been validated.
- A signed-out person is sent through local login and then resumes the pending
  consent screen. The screen identifies the client and explains that the
  stable account identifier will be shared.
- Consent is requested for every authorization. Allowing binds the request to
  the current account; denying returns `access_denied` and the original state
  to the validated redirect URI.
- The authorization code expires with its ten-minute request, is bound to the
  client, redirect, and PKCE verifier, and succeeds in at most one concurrent
  exchange.
- Successful exchange returns a five-minute RS256 ID token and opaque bearer
  access token. The issuer is Authling's immutable public URL and `sub` is the
  Authling account ID. UserInfo returns only `sub`. Access-token state also
  binds the client, granted scopes, and authorization callback origin.
- A Chatto frontend can use its own authorization as the global client session,
  then start a separate Chatto-server authorization through a provider that
  advertises the same issuer. Authling's browser session is reused, but each
  client receives only its own code, token, redirect, and granted scopes.
- Protocol state and token records are encrypted at rest and stored under
  non-reversible runtime keys. Raw codes and tokens are not durable keys and
  are never logged.
- Browser-capable discovery, JWKS, token, and UserInfo endpoints allow
  credential-free CORS. Authorization and consent do not.

## Conventional Clients

An operator declares conventional clients with `[[oidc.clients]]`. An empty
secret creates a public client using token endpoint authentication method
`none`; a secret of at least 32 characters creates a `client_secret_basic`
client. Both still require PKCE.

## CIMD Clients

An unconfigured HTTPS URL client ID is resolved as a Client ID Metadata
Document. It must describe that exact client ID, public token authentication,
one or more safe redirect URIs, and no flow outside Authorization Code. Fetches
are HTTPS-only, do not follow redirects, reject special-use destinations,
ignore proxy configuration, and have strict concurrency, response-size,
timeout, and cache bounds. Invalid responses are never cached.

Special-use destinations are rejected by default. Operators may explicitly
trust exact CIMD hostnames that resolve to private addresses for controlled
development networks. That exception admits only private addresses for the
named hosts and never loopback, link-local, multicast, or other special-use
destinations.

## Security and Failure Behavior

- An issuer mismatch or signing-key mismatch prevents readiness.
- Duplicate security-sensitive authorization parameters, missing or weak
  PKCE, unsupported scopes and response modes, request objects, and
  `prompt=none` fail closed.
- Consent and login POSTs require Authling's exact browser origin. Pending IDs
  are resolved server-side and cannot carry an arbitrary return URL.
- A storage conflict during approval or code claim fails the operation instead
  of creating two grants.
- Failure responses do not reveal client secrets, codes, tokens, account IDs,
  email addresses, or complete request URLs.

## Limitations

- Only local password authentication and the `pwd` authentication-method
  reference exist.
- Refresh tokens, token revocation, RP-initiated logout, further scopes and
  claims, persistent consent, application grouping, key rotation, and official
  conformance-suite automation are not implemented.
- CIMD remains an Internet-Draft. Authling implements the reviewed draft-02
  profile and may need an explicit migration as the document evolves.
