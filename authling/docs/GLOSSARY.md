# Authling Glossary

This glossary defines canonical Authling terminology. Do not copy Chatto terms
here unless Authling uses the same word with an explicitly defined meaning.

## Product

**Authling** — An independent, self-hostable identity provider and light
user-controlled metadata service. Authling may be trusted by Chatto servers but
is not itself a Chatto server or a user's home server.

**Account** — Authling's opaque aggregate for one user identity. Its account ID
is the stable OpenID Connect subject (`sub`) exposed to authorized clients. A local
account may have an encrypted, verified email/password credential and one or
more independent browser sessions. Accounts do not yet have profile data or
OIDC grants.

**Local credential** — An Authling login method based on a verified normalized
email address and an Argon2id password verifier. Both values are retained only
inside an encrypted credential payload.

**Signup flow** — Short-lived, encrypted runtime state that carries an email
verification challenge to account creation. It is not an account and expires
after 15 minutes.

**Browser session** — Short-lived, server-side runtime state that binds an
opaque browser cookie to one account after signup or login. A session is not a
durable account fact and can be revoked independently from other sessions.

**Issuer** — The immutable public URL identifying one Authling deployment as
one OpenID Provider. Tokens and discovery use this exact value; changing it is
an identity migration, not an ordinary listener reconfiguration.

**Relying party** — An application that asks Authling to authenticate an
account through OpenID Connect. Its individual protocol identity is an OIDC
client.

**Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)** — An HTTPS JSON document whose URL is
also a public OIDC client's identifier. Authling uses CIMD for automatic,
read-only client onboarding without a dynamic registration write API.

**Account data space** — One small, global, account-owned TinyBase data set that
user devices synchronize through Authling. It is independent of Chatto servers
and does not yet contain application namespaces. An OIDC client can receive
read and write access through explicit consent for the `account_data` scope.

**TinyBase peer** — One participant in TinyBase synchronization. Authling is
the durable, always-online peer; each user device is another peer with its own
local `MergeableStore`.

## Data protection

**Cryptographic erasure** — Making encrypted Authling data permanently
unreadable by irreversibly destroying the key material required to decrypt it.
Authling uses this to erase data from immutable event history without rewriting
that history.

**Data key** — A random, purpose- and epoch-scoped encryption key used to
encrypt sensitive account, credential, or application data. Data keys are
wrapped by a user key and referenced opaquely from durable events.

**User key** — An account-scoped, KMS-managed wrapping key. Destroying a user
key makes all data keys wrapped by it unusable and provides Authling's
account-wide cryptographic-erasure boundary.
